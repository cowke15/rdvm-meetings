## Decisions Made

### Market Positioning / Availability
- Accept that regional price increases and longer wait times at nearby ophthalmology practices strengthen AEC’s positioning.
- No changes to AEC pricing or scheduling strategy despite Pleasanton cancellations from clients seeking earlier openings elsewhere.

### Online Scheduling & Conversion
- Treat online self-scheduling conversion rates as broadly within expected range.
- Use online scheduling primarily for long-term trend tracking rather than reacting to month-to-month swings.
- Maintain existing Acuity + online scheduling workflow (no major changes).

### On-Hold Message
- Proceed with updated on-hold message using Ashley’s script.
- Jason to generate recording via 11Labs.
- Collin to add music and adjust pacing.
- Open to light trimming of script, but no exact cuts finalized.

### Paper vs. Electronic Records
- Long-term direction is to reduce duplicated paper effort and rely more on VR.
- No transition plan or deadline established.

## Open Issues

### Competitor Availability & Pricing
- Drivers of extended wait times at Sage, Animal Eye Specialists Campbell, etc.
- Impact of regional price increases on AEC demand and cancellation patterns.
- Internet outage effects and backlog dynamics not fully analyzed.

### Online Scheduling Data
- Clarify definitions and sources for conversion metrics.
- Separate total conversion vs. online-only self-scheduling conversion.

### New Hospitals & Market Intelligence
- Confirm ownership, service mix, and positioning of:
  - Rossmore Pet Hospital (Walnut Creek)
  - Vets for Pets (Dublin)
  - Fairfield acquisition (multi-practice owner)
- Assess overlap and referral impact.

### Exam Form Automation
- No scalable solution yet for auto-populating exam forms from Acuity PDFs.
- AI/Python prototypes unreliable or require custom app build.
- Open question: is automation effort justified by time savings?

### Scanning & Document Management
- No finalized approach for bulk scanning and document matching.
- Multi-page visit handling remains operationally heavy.
- Doctor willingness to reduce paper still uncertain.

## To-Dos

### Jason
- Generate updated on-hold recording via 11Labs.
- Coordinate pacing/music timing with Collin.
- Share exam-form automation discussion with Alex; assess viability of structured PDF → form-fill workflow.
- Report back on maintainability and ROI.

### Collin
- Add background music and pacing edits to on-hold recording.
- Support Caitlin in testing exam-form automation tools.
- Interpret technical input from Alex.

### Caitlin
- Continue competitor wait-time and pricing tracking.
- Research Rossmore Pet Hospital, Vets for Pets (Dublin), Fairfield acquisition.
- Update Trello with findings.
- Quantify time burden of hand-filling forms and scanning workflow.

### Ashley
- Create Trello card for exam-form automation project.
- Ensure clear assignment of Jason for on-hold + Alex outreach.
- Add Lauren to board for on-hold audio management.

### Laura
- Notify front desk/CSRs when on-hold update goes live.
- Gather feedback on clarity, length, and client confusion.

## Risks / Watch Items

### Regional Capacity & Access
- Longer wait times regionally may push urgent cases farther.
- Cancellations may increase if earlier options open elsewhere.

### Pricing Dynamics
- Uneven regional pricing shifts could temporarily redirect demand.
- Lower-cost providers (e.g., Sacramento) may normalize over time.

### Client Friction
- Competitor phone issues may confuse owners and distort availability comparisons.

### Operational Drag (Paper Charts)
- ~$30K/year in time/materials tied to physical charts.
- Staff burnout risk from printing, handwriting, scanning.
- Doctor resistance may slow needed operational changes.

### Automation Reliability
- AI/Python workflows for exam forms may introduce errors or require high oversight.

## General Notes

- Multiple ophthalmology practices raising prices ($280–$380+).
- Sacramento currently underpriced (~$165) but expected to normalize.
- Clients willing to travel for earlier appointments or lower cost.
- Online conversion appears comparable to phone when behavior differences considered.
- Some online users submit multiple inquiries, slightly depressing conversion.
- New market entrants could reshape referral dynamics.
- Strong doctor preference for paper charts persists.
- Any shift away from paper requires cost/time framing and full doctor buy-in.
