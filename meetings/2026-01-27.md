## Decisions Made
- Keep self-scheduling turned on, but treat it as a leaky but necessary channel rather than something to shut off.
- Pursue a focused data / micro-analysis project on self-scheduling (conversion, volume, schedule impact) before making structural changes.
- Explore low-effort / high-impact mitigations first (educational content, chat/text options, UI tweaks), then sequence changes based on capacity and projected impact.
- Treat Allison’s extra day and schedule tweaks as a potential capacity lever, but not yet a permanent assumption.
- Defer major structural schedule changes until Dr. Davis’s availability stabilizes.

## Open Issues
- True net impact of self-scheduled appointments on:
  - Overall inquiry volume  
  - Conversion rates  
  - Schedule “days out” and availability  
- Extent to which rechecks are cannibalizing new-appointment slots, especially under recent template changes (e.g., Dr. Hamilton).
- Optimal online experience (content, UX, chat/text) to close the conversion gap vs. phone.
- Timing and permanence of Allison adding an extra day.
- Balancing recheck vs. new availability without negatively affecting procedures and doctor preferences.

## To-Dos
- Ashley — Prioritize mitigation options (sequence by impact, effort, and capacity constraints).
- Brielle —
  - Monitor self-scheduled vs. phone inquiry metrics (inquiries, conversion, days-out availability, recheck-to-new ratio) through February.
  - Provide updated analysis and recommendations at the next marketing meeting.
  - Prepare updated marketing tier information for the February meeting.
  - Implement a distinct tracking/type flag for rechecks placed into new slots.
- Collin —
  - Help prioritize mitigation options with Ashley (impact vs. effort, timing constraints).
  - Build scheduling-page and website changes (educational content, UI iterations) in a test/dry-dock environment.
  - Audit scheduling practices (availability dropdown vs. drag-and-drop usage) and report impact on online availability.
- Jason — Run a micro-analysis of self-scheduling:
  - Pull data and model conversion/volume effects.
  - Identify root causes of lower online conversion.
  - Produce a prioritized mitigation list (education, chat/text, UI changes) with estimated impact and complexity.

## Risks / Watch Items
- Conversion gap: self-scheduled inquiries convert at ~50% vs. 70–75% for phone callers.
- No clear inquiry volume lift from self-scheduling; risk of diluting inquiry quality without adding demand.
- Schedule availability (days out) likely suppressing online conversion.
- Template changes and recheck usage potentially eroding new availability (especially Dr. Hamilton).
- Capacity risk: conversion improvements must align with sufficient doctor availability (Allison’s schedule, Dr. Davis’s stability).

## General Notes
- Self-scheduling has not meaningfully increased inquiries, but market expectations still favor offering an online option.
- Counterfactual challenge: without a controlled test, true impact of self-scheduling is difficult to isolate.
- 24% of inquiries are self-scheduled, but only 14% of appointments originate from self-scheduling (weaker conversion; possible “window shoppers”).
- Education and reassurance in the online flow may improve conversion (e.g., clearer expectations, explanatory content or video).
- Live chat or text may provide a low-friction alternative for users hesitant to call.
- Recheck-to-new ratio currently ~2.5:1, with limited revenue shift under existing templates.
- Dr. Hamilton appears to underperform on new appointments relative to template, likely due to dynamic slot behavior and recent schedule adjustments.
