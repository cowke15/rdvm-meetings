## Decisions Made

### Doctor Communication / RDVM Support
- Focus first on internal process design for RDVM communication (triage, routing, documentation) before selecting a specific tech front-end.
- Prefer phone/text workflows (RingCentral voicemail + transcription, SMS, potential RDVM hotline) over a public web form.
- Use voicemail transcription to group inbox as the core fallback mechanism.
- Continue triaging RDVM requests through Amy/techs first, not directly to doctors whenever possible.

### Text Reminders & Scheduling
- Continue using Acuity as the scheduling platform (card effectively resolved).
- Keep four-day text reminder as baseline.
- Continue testing one-day replyable text; iterate in phases.
- Treat multi-phase text/confirmation/waitlist system as a longer roadmap.
- Acknowledge Acuity’s single-text limitation; additional behavior requires ClickSend/Zapier.

### Referral & Revenue Analysis
- Use AI/ChatGPT to define required data fields from Acuity, financials, and VR for capacity/fill-rate/revenue modeling.
- Brielle and Caitlin to refine tiered RDVM targeting based on referral performance and outreach notes.
- Maintain high-demand posture; do not reduce outreach simply because schedule is full.

### Insurance Documentation
- Keep insurance documentation project in progress.
- Tie project to future insurance-coordinator role and internal knowledge base.

### NVA CE Events
- Approve coordination of three NVA CE events (likely virtual).
- Holly to serve as content owner.

### Meeting Cadence
- Default to weekly AEC marketing meetings (skips around holidays as needed).

## Open Issues

### RDVM Workflow
- Exact routing flow for RDVM hotline/voicemail not finalized.
- CSR scripting and expectation-setting not defined.
- Ensuring timely callbacks during surgery/packed days.

### Text Reminders
- Final standardized reminder language not locked.
- Full multi-reminder cadence not yet implemented.
- Weekend-to-Monday timing risk.

### Referral & Revenue Analysis
- Complete data pull for modeling not assembled.
- Tier definitions not fully normalized.
- Framework for allocating Caitlin’s time/CE resources not finalized.

### Insurance Process
- VR insurance letter not fully validated.
- No standardized trigger/completion/sending workflow.

### NVA CE
- Topics, dates, logistics not confirmed.
- Need confirmation of Holly’s content readiness.

## To-Dos

### Caitlin
- Meet with Collin to review texting/reminder setup and define next phases.
- Meet with Brielle to align on outreach logging and tier assignments.
- Coordinate with Holly on NVA CE topics/materials.

### Collin
- Add phased texting/reminder roadmap to Trello.
- Audit Acuity/ClickSend/Zapier routing and document findings.

### Jason
- Send finalized data field list for capacity/revenue modeling.
- Design and pilot insurance-coordinator role.
- Scope and prototype dedicated RDVM contact channel (RingCentral call + SMS).

### Brielle
- Complete revenue/referral trend write-up (2024→2025).
- Document early conclusions and data gaps on targeted RDVM card.

### Ashley
- Clean up Trello (move scheduling to Completed; keep insurance card In Progress).

## Risks / Watch Items

- Capacity constraints (recheck/surgery availability vs. growth).
- RDVM relationship friction if callback flow is poor.
- Over-automation harming relationship quality.
- Multi-tool stack (Acuity + ClickSend + Zapier + RingCentral) complexity risk.
- Data inconsistency undermining AI modeling reliability.
- Insurance documentation workload burdening clinical staff.

---

## General Notes

- Strong interest in creating a “ticketing-like” RDVM flow with voicemail transcription.
- Interest in dedicated RDVM text line (“inside line” model).
- Early signal: “never referred” clinics visited by Caitlin show meaningful growth.
- Need quasi-sales allocation framework for CE, visits, gifts, and time.
- Jason emphasized maintaining scarcity mindset despite full schedule.
- Insurance-coordinator pilot intended to centralize documentation work.
- NVA CE likely virtual; Caitlin coordinating with Holly.
