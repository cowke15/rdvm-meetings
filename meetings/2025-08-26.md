## Decisions Made

### Nextdoor Monitoring & Use
- Treat Nextdoor as a tertiary / low-priority marketing channel with occasional high-value opportunities.
- No dedicated manual monitoring process will be created.
- Caitlin will keep notifications enabled and respond when relevant posts appear.
- Remove or deprioritize outdated/duplicate business profiles if cleanup is not feasible.

### Swag / Online Store / Client Appreciation
- Swag is “nice to have,” not high priority.
- Any public-facing store must be low effort, low cost, and minimize tax/reporting burden.
- Prefer marketplace facilitators (e.g., Etsy + Printify) to handle sales tax collection in California.
- Avoid inventory management and in-clinic retail operations for now.
- No final decision on public vs. internal-only store; brand-risk concerns acknowledged but not a blocker.
- Focus on client appreciation and relationship value over revenue generation.

### Scheduling, Capacity & Drop-Off Strategy
- Priority: avoid becoming >2 weeks booked out to preserve goodwill.
- Use drop-offs strategically to rescue urgent/hesitant cases.
- Fremont: tightly constrained (two staff; limited fit-ins; rare drop-offs).
- Pleasanton: primary overflow site for drop-offs, ER cases, and Fremont rechecks.
- Dr. Hamilton in Fremont will use 30-minute slots only (reduced case volume acknowledged).

### Client Gifts & In-Clinic Experience
- Support small, tasteful appreciation gestures (e.g., mugs, possible photo concepts).
- Avoid building large physical inventory.
- Any photo displays must be polished and mindful of marketing consents and volume.

## Open Issues

### Nextdoor Platform & Automation
- Unclear linkage between personal and business profiles.
- Notification inconsistencies unresolved.
- Unclear whether automation is technically feasible due to closed-community structure.
- Open question on viability and security of ChatGPT/agent-based login solutions.

### Swag Strategy & Tax / Compliance
- Clarify whether store would be public, internal, or invite-only.
- Confirm CA sales tax obligations for marketplace vs. direct e-commerce platforms.
- Define acceptable product mix, quality, and pricing guardrails.

### Client Appreciation & Photo Concepts
- Decision pending on Polaroid/instant photo giveaways.
- Balance between digital vs. printed assets.
- Define marketing consent usage policies.
- Determine whether any in-clinic photo displays are appropriate.

### Scheduling, Capacity & Fremont Rollout
- Unknown Fremont demand under compressed schedule.
- Define sustainable daily drop-off limits in Pleasanton.
- Clarify extension boundaries for staff/doctors.
- Messaging plan for Fremont-to-Pleasanton recheck transitions.

## Risks / Watch Items

### Missed Nextdoor Opportunities
- Risk of missing rare high-value ophthalmology referral posts.
- Single-point-of-failure risk if relying only on Caitlin’s notifications.

### Brand Risk from Public Swag
- Potential misuse of AEC branding by non-staff.
- Possible confusion about employee status.

### Tax & Compliance Exposure
- Incorrect platform selection could create sales tax/reporting burden.

### Capacity, Burnout & Goodwill
- Reduced appointment capacity and drop-offs may extend workdays.
- Risk of staff burnout.
- If booking >2 weeks out, potential loss of goodwill from clients and RDVMs.

### Client Satisfaction (Location & Timing)
- Fremont clients may resist Pleasanton rechecks.
- Drop-off vs. in-person messaging must be handled carefully to maintain trust.

## General Notes

- Nextdoor viewed as confusing and historically poor ROI for ads.
- Value is episodic, not scalable.
- Interest in relationship-based swag rather than revenue-based merchandising.
- Existing mugs can serve as appreciation gifts.
- Staff already produce strong patient photos; marketing consents limit posting.
- Recent operational days exceeded planned capacity (e.g., 44 vs. 41 cases).
- Team expects upcoming months to be operationally challenging.
- Emphasis on preserving goodwill with referring vets and clients.
